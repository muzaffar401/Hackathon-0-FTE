## Post Content
🏡 After 3 years of working remotely, I've learned that success isn't just about having a good WiFi connection.

The secret? It's all in the routines you build.

Here are my top 3 game-changing habits that transformed my remote work experience:

1. The "Fake Commute"
I take a 15-minute walk before and after work. It creates a mental boundary between work and personal life – something we often lose when working from home.

2. The 90/20 Rule
Work focused for 90 minutes, then take a deliberate 20-minute break. No exceptions. This rhythm has doubled my productivity and reduced screen fatigue.

3. The "Meeting-Free Mornings"
I block my calendar until 11 AM for deep work. Those quiet morning hours are pure gold for complex tasks and creative thinking.

But here's what nobody tells you: Remote work isn't one-size-fits-all. The key is experimenting until you find what works for YOU.

What's your best remote work habit? Share your tips in the comments below – let's learn from each other! 👇
