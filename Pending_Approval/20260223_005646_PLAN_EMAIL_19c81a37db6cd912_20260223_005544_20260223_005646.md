## Risk Assessment: HIGH RISK ⚠️
This appears to be a potential phishing email requiring careful verification before any action. Security-related emails should always be treated with high caution.

## Objective
Verify legitimacy of Microsoft security notification and take appropriate security measures if needed.

## Required Steps

### Initial Verification
- [ ] Check the exact sender email address for authenticity
- [ ] Verify if the partially hidden email (ma**7@gmail.com) matches any known account
- [ ] Look for typical phishing red flags (urgent language, grammar errors, unusual formatting)
- [ ] DO NOT click any links in the email

### Security Actions
- [ ] Independently visit Microsoft account security page (type URL directly, don't use email links)
- [ ] Check account activity log for any recent security changes
- [ ] Verify if a passkey was actually added to the account
- [ ] Enable two-factor authentication if not already active

### Follow-up Actions
- [ ] If legitimate: Archive the email
- [ ] If suspicious:
  - [ ] Report as phishing through email client
  - [ ] Forward to Microsoft's security team (phishing@microsoft.com)
  - [ ] Delete after reporting

## ⚠️ Human Approval Required
This task requires human approval because:

2. Potential phishing risk
3. Could impact account access

## Notes
- Never click links in security-related emails
- Always verify through official channels
- When in doubt, contact Microsoft support directly
